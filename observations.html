        <p class="intro-text">
            Through direct user observation and interviews with students, I identified some major challenges faced by users of the dorm laundry machines.

            <h2>üìç Selected Interface: Brown University Dorm Laundry Machines</h2>
            <p>Students must live on campus for their first three years, making accessible laundry facilities in dorms a necessity. 
                These washing machines are designed to be industrial, safe, and user-friendly, with three key components.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1. The door: students can open and close it and it locks automatically during a wash cycle.</li>
                <li>2. The keypad: allows students to select wash settings for water temperature, soil level, and fabric 
                    type.</li>
                <li>3. Sticker: has QR code and Bluetooth chip, which students must use to register machine via an app before starting a load.</li>

            <div class="observation">
                <h3>üö™ Washer Doors</h3>
                <p>Students had trouble closing the door, due to not pushing it hard enough. I watched several users push the door shut and have it bounce back open. They then had to slam the door shut for it to remain closed.</p>

            <div class="observation">
                <h3>üì± App Usage </h3>
                <p>Users struggled with the app required to start the washing machine. Many students apps would not load correctly, and they would have to try multiple times to get it to work. Sometimes it did not end up working at all and the user could not use the washing machine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="observation">
                <h3>üî¢ Machine Keypad </h3>
                <p>Most students do not change the default settings of the washing machine on the keypad.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="observation">
                <h3>üí≥ Payment System</h3>
                <p>Some students tried tapping their Brown IDs against the sticker rather than their phone.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="observation">
                <h3>üìè Machine Location</h3>
                <p>All students had to crouch low or even sit on the ground in order to be able to insert their laundry into the door of the washing machine.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="observation">
                <h3>üßº Detergent Placement</h3>
                <p>Some students use detergent pods and others use liquid detergent. Most students put both products directly into the washing machine and not in the tray.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Can you describe your experience using the laundry machines in this dorm?</li>
                    <li>2. How intuitive do you find the washing machines to use?</li>
                    <li>3. Were there any aspects of the interface (buttons, labels, payment system, instructions) that confused you?</li>
                    <li>4. Have you ever avoided doing laundry at certain times because of the interface or system? If so, why?</li>
                    <li>5. Have you ever considered using an off-campus laundry service instead? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>6. Do you think the signage or instructions in the laundry room are sufficient? Why or why not?</li>
                    <li>7. How do you feel about the payment method used for the machines?</li>
                    <li>8. If you could change anything about how the laundry machines function or are designed, what would it be?</li>

            <div class="summary">
                <h3>üìä Interview Summary</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: justify;">When conducting these interviews, I was met with a lot of frustration towards the dorm laundry machines, mostly in regards to 
                    long wait times, constant app failures, and an overall inefficient process. I was told that the app rarely works on the first try, forcing multiple refreshes, 
                    reinstallations, and QR code scans. Sometimes it does not work at all. While all agreed that the interface itself is intuitive with clear signage, students think 
                    adding a troubleshooting phone number would help when issues do arise. These students claimed that the biggest issue is the pointless app dependent payment step, 
                    which adds unnecessary hassle seeing as the laundry is actually free. Because of these problems, many put off doing laundry until they have no choice, and 
                    some avoid it entirely when they are already having a bad day.
                </p>

                <h3>üí° Student Suggestions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eliminating the App</strong> - Allowing machines to start by pressing the physical button would mitigate most current issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improving Signage</strong> -  Adding a contact number for technical support would be useful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raising Machine Height</strong> - Increasing machine height from the floor would improve comfort and usability.</li>
