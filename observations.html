            <p>The dorm laundry system is a self service facility where students wash and dry their clothes. Machines require students to scan a QR code via an app to start the wash cycle.</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>6. Do you think the signage or instructions in the laundry room are sufficient? Why or why not?</li>

                <h3>üìä Interview Summary</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 16px;text-align: justify;">When conducting these interviews, I was met with a lot of frustration towards the dorm laundry machines, mostly in regards to 
                    long wait times, constant app failures, and an overall inefficient process. I was told that the app rarely works on the first try, forcing multiple refreshes, 
                    reinstallations, and QR code scans. Sometimes it does not work at all. While all agreed that the interface itself is intuitive with clear signage, students think 
                    adding a troubleshooting phone number would help when issues do arise. These students claimed that the biggest issue is the pointless app dependent payment step, 
                    which adds unnecessary hassle seeing as the laundry is actually free. Because of these problems, many put off doing laundry until they have no choice, and 
                    some avoid it entirely when they are already having a bad day.

                <h3>üí° Student Suggestions</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eliminating the App</strong> - Removing the app entirely and allowing machines to start with a physical button would mitigate most current issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improving Signage</strong> -  Adding a contact number for technical support would be useful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raising Machine Height</strong> - Elevating machines would improve comfort and usability.</li>
